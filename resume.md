### Principal Product Manager, 2016 - Present

Develop product strategy and then lead the development and delivery of multiple products to market in partnership with other PMs, UX professionals and Technical Project Managers.  Research new features and write one pagers, user stories and other artifacts to help developers build the best possible products.   As needed serve as a scrummaster and TPM.  I also provide leadership to other PMs and TPMs on the team.

* Launched a dev team to develop and deploy a video conferencing (WebRTC) platform API and SDK that powered a new consumer healthcare platform serving our web and mobile consumers while significantly reducing cross team dependencies.
* Delivered a FHIR standard API platform that allowed application  access to the enterprise’s electronic medical record systems.  The delivery of this platform allowed us to radically increase the frequency of new feature deployments from once/quarter to almost daily.
* Gathered requirements and led delivery for a new consumer facing account management platform to replace an aging API with an OAuth standard system that was then subsequently deployed across our mobile and web facing applications.  This strategically laid the groundwork for single sign on for consumers.
* Led the development of  a Telehealth Cart solution described as “Brain Dead Simple” by the nursing team.  It featured a zero touch setup, automated self test procedure and both back-end status monitoring as well as a local health indicator.
* Selected by SVP of Product and the Chief of Staff to provide manager consulting and guidance on employee engagement initiatives in response to the yearly survey.

### Manager, Telehealth Solutions and Support, 2014 - 2016

* Built a new agile scrum team and educated the Telehealth Leadership in how to govern the new model and integrate it into the operational support processes.
* I researched and proposed new technologies for the automation and deployment of test environments that led to the adoption of open source tools (puppet/vagrant) that reduce deployment time for test carts by 80%.
* Successfully released feedback widget (measure satisfaction), Far End Camera Controls (eliminate frustration), application logging (speed up troubleshooting) and auto-update (simplify support) features in first year with a brand new development team.
* I led the assessment with legal to evaluate custom software against FDA compliance criteria.  This required deep subject matter expertise around FDA MDDS law, deployed technology and legal precedent in Telehealth.
* Drove the  Enterprise security assessments for our custom software to complete threat models, analyze them and ensure compliance.
