Everything is ephemeral.  All of our perceptions, belongings, reality and the u niverse at large is ephemeral.  It eventually goes away.  It changes, mutates, becomes something else, dies, transitions, undoes, unties or just isn't anymore.

The moment we're in now passes in an infestimally small quantum.  What was is already not by the team we perceive it.  If a tree falls in the woods.....

Out of this comes the unending dynamism and humming vitality of life.  Stasis is a stopped heart or a frozen landscape.  Out among the universe are vibrating strings or dancing partciles that materialize and de-materialize until they interact with each other so much that they make brains and feet and legs and those brains have memory that makes the illusion of permanence.

So here's where I capture some of those thoughts before they go away.  While they sit flowing from dentrites to axons over and over again until they are retrieved and known.  Digital media, previously the physical alignment of ferromagnetic bits on a spinning platter, offers a way to offload it.

Make no mistakes.  Bitrot is real and data goes away.  Once the computers stop working, well so too does the storing of the information but for now this will do.
