### About this Blog
I built this blog for a couple reasons.  The first is that I enjoy writing now and again.  Sometimes about work and often about family, fishing or mini-farming and sometimes combinations of the above.  Second, I chose the platform I did so that I'd get my hands dirty learning something new.  It turns out static site generators are very powerful but non-trivial, at least for me.  
### About This Site
This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on Github using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).  I use a [Minima-modified](https://github.com/livysdad27/minima-modified) theme, that I forked from minima, although there are a ton of [really great themes](http://jekyllthemes.org) for Jekyll out there.
### About the Weather Link
The [Weather link](https://weather.boggyhollowfarm.com/) goes to a [weewx](https://weewx.com/) instance running on an Amazon Lightsail.  It used to be fed from a [Raspberry Pi 400](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400/) (also running weewx) running in my house that polls for UDP pakcets from a  [Weatherflow Tempest](https://weatherflow.com/tempest-weather-system/).  For that I used the Weewx [Weatherflow UDP driver from captain-coredump](https://github.com/captain-coredump/weatherflow-udp) which works rather nicely!  The Tempest comes with a REST, UDP Broadcast and Websocket API that are all fun to play with.  It also has out of the box integrations including to [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/dashboard/pws/KWAOLYMP512) where my station is named [KWAOLYMP512](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/us/wa/olympia/KWAOLYMP512).  

Since using the UDP interface I decided I wanted to publish my data to the public internet.  To do that I spun up an Amazon Lightsail server and begain forwarding data to it using the Weewx Rsync report.  While that worked it seemed wasteful to have a middle man when the data is availalbe via an API so ia built a custom Weewx driver for the Weatherflow WS API.  It can be found at [in this github repo](https://github.com/captain-coredump/weatherflow-udp).  There are still some improvements to make around when the Tempest goes offline (loss of power primarily) and I'd like to setup an auto-restart for the Weewx service to recover from failures but all up it's proven to be pretty stable.  I also wrote a Weewx WIKI page on [driver development tips](https://github.com/weewx/weewx/wiki/Weewx-Driver-Development-Tips) to capture what I learned.
