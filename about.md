At work I'm a Product Manager who has spent more than two decades in the Healthcare Space.  

At home I get to hang out with my lovely wife, youngest kid, three dogs, two parakeets, one cat, one turtle and a goat.  There are lots of deer and racoons too but they don't like to play.

Out and about I like to be around the further flung members of my family (and friends count for that too).

When I'm alone I like to be around the water, woods or mountains.
