At work I'm a Product Manager who has spent more than two decades in the Healthcare Space.  

At home I get to hang out with my lovely wife, youngest kid, three dogs, two parakeets, one cat, one turtle and a goat.  There are lots of deer and racoons too but they don't like to play.

Out and about I like to be around the further flung members of my family (and friends count for that too).

When I'm alone I like to be around the water, woods or mountains.

### About This Site
This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on Github using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).  I use the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme although there are a ton of [really great themes](http://jekyllthemes.org) for Jekyll out there.
