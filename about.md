I built this site for a few reasons.  The first is that I used to enjoy blogging and writing now and again.  Sometimes this was about work and often it was about family, fishing or mini-farming and sometimes combinations of the above.  Second, I chose the platform I did so that I'd get my hands dirty learning something new.  It turns out static site generators are very powerful but non-trivial, at least for me.  Some of the writing on here is really professional facing.  I have my resume as a top level part of this page for instance.  But I think over time I want it to be less work and more of, well, everything.

### About This Site
This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on Github using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).  I use the [Minima-modified](https://github.com/livysdad27/minima-modified) theme, that I forked from minima, although there are a ton of [really great themes](http://jekyllthemes.org) for Jekyll out there.
